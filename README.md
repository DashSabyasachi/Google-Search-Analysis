# Google-Search-Analysis
This project analyzes global Google search trends for the topic "Machine Learning" using the PyTrends Python library, which interfaces with the Google Trends API to fetch, process, and visualize interest data by region and over time. The code retrieves and visualizes the top ten countries where "Machine Learning" searches are most popular, presenting the results in a bar chart for clear regional comparison, and plots a time series graph to show how worldwide interest has evolved throughout the years, using pandas and matplotlib for data handling and charting.​

Project Highlights
The project demonstrates practical use of PyTrends for extracting Google search data on any keyword, converting it into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or visualization.​

Such analysis can reveal geographical hotspots of interest and show the temporal evolution of a search topic, making the findings valuable for market research, academic studies, and content strategy decisions.​

The project's approach—regional ranking, time series analysis, and clear visualization—provides an accessible template for exploring other keywords or topics using Google Trends programmatically.
